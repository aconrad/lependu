This is a word resolver for the Hangman game. I wrote it while I was bored on the plane. The in-flight entertainment screen had the Hangman game available to play and I thought I would write a program to help me guess the words more easily by tapping into the dictionary and finding plausible words.

# TODO

* filter out words that have letters that didn't match. E.g., if letter "j" was attempted but didn't match any position in the word to be resolved, then all possible words that contain the letter j should be filtered out.
